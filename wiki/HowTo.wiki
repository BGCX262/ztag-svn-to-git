= HowTo =

== Install ==
Just goto [http://code.google.com/p/ztag/downloads/list Downloads] page and get the last version of zTag Package, extract the db and ztag folders to your web site root and try to execute some tests like.

http://localhost/ztag/ztag.php?temp=/ztag/sample/helloworld.ztag

Or, if you download or add the .htaccess to your root folder too, you can use the extension .ztag as follow

http://localhost/ztag/sample/helloworld.ztag

Now you can check and use all other zTag files at /ztag/sample folder.
