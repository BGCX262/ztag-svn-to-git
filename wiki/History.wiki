#summary A brief report about the zTag history.

  * 1998 - Ruben Zevallos and Fernando Aquino had an idea about the use of tags to facilitate interaction between the HTML and ASP code;
  * 1998 - Ruben created some models to test ideas using the tags;
  * 1998 - Ruben developed the CMS Publisher Sites (now Onyx Manager);
  * 2002 - Ruben created the first zTags to facilitate his development;
  * 2003 - Ruben rewrote the core of the CMS, including the first version of the processor zTags;
  * 2005 - Ruben again rewrote the code of zTags processor, including the first intelligent zTags;
  * 2007 - Ruben rewrote the entire CMS, creating a new concept of zTags, including among other zTagSQL;
  * 2009 - André Mácola showed a fantastic use of zTags, he wore the zTagSQL creating true "systems". That gave Ruben a realistic view of the use of zTags outside the CMS;
  * 2008 - Ruben wrote the first version of HTML reader for a project to CRUD manager;
  * 2009 - Ruben researched the RegEx to create a new processor ztag including new nested zTags;
  * 2010 - (May) Ruben started the new processor zTags, but he needed to understand how a ztag nested within another;
  * 2010 - (Sep) Ruben found the solution to the nested zTags and began development of the current project.

The idea of having a system of independent zTags Onyx Manager, came the need to save time in the development of silly things such as CRUDs, Lists, Reports and some forms of treatment.

Today, the zTag project is a mix of ideas from Ruben's programming experience, that includes his 98 framework named HyperTools (http://www.HiperTools.com.br) and other.
